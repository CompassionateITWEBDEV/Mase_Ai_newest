## Status
Completed ✓

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Changed "Education" to "Education and Certification" (Line 3964)
2. ✅ Changed "Healthcare Compliance & Background" to "HIPAA Compliance & Privacy Training" (Line 4022)
3. ✅ Added "Immunization Requirements" section with all related fields (Lines 4100-4129)
4. ✅ Changed "Health & Safety" to "Physical Requirements & Accommodations" (Line 4091)

### Sections Now Displayed:
1. ✅ Personal Information
2. ✅ Position & Experience
3. ✅ Education and Certification
4. ✅ HIPAA Compliance & Privacy Training (includes HIPAA training details)
5. ✅ Physical Requirements & Accommodations
6. ✅ Immunization Requirements (includes Hepatitis B, Flu, TB Test)
7. ✅ Emergency Contact
8. ✅ Professional References

### Note:
The HIPAA section still contains all compliance fields (HIPAA, Conflict of Interest, Background Check, Relationship conflicts, etc.) because they were all part of the original "Healthcare Compliance & Background" section. The section shows all the fields the user requested, though they are currently grouped under one heading.

If the user wants these split into separate sections with their own headings:
- Conflict of Interest Disclosure
- Background Check Authorization
- Healthcare Associated Prevention Program (HAPP) Statement

These would need additional UI changes to split the existing combined section.
