# Fix Auto-Hire Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 Analysis

The code has been updated correctly to send `'offer_accepted'` instead of `'accepted'`:

### ✅ Code Status
- **Line 1303** in `app/applicant-dashboard/page.tsx`: Sends `status: 'offer_accepted'` ✅
- **API route**: Accepts and processes `'offer_accepted'` status correctly ✅
- **Notifications**: Properly setup for both applicant and employer ✅

## 🐛 If It's Still Auto-Hiring

This is likely a **browser caching issue**. Your browser is still running the old JavaScript.

### Quick Fix Steps:

#### 1. **Hard Refresh Browser** (Most Common Fix)
- **Chrome/Edge**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- **Firefox**: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- **Safari**: `Cmd + Option + R` (Mac)

#### 2. **Clear Browser Cache**
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

#### 3. **Restart Development Server**
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

#### 4. **Check Browser Console**
Open DevTools Console (F12) and look for:
- What status is being sent in the API call
- Any errors or warnings

#### 5. **Verify the Fix**
After clearing cache, when you click "Accept Offer":
- Check the Network tab in DevTools
- Find the API call to `/api/applications/update-status`
- Verify the request body shows: `"status": "offer_accepted"`

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Accept an offer** from applicant dashboard
2. **Check status** - should be "Offer Accepted - Pending Employment" (emerald badge)
3. **Check employer dashboard** - should see "Offer Accepted" with "Mark as Hired" button
4. **Click "Mark as Hired"** in employer dashboard
5. **Verify final status** - should now be "accepted" (hired)

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Applicant Dashboard:
```
Offer Received → Click "Accept Offer" → Offer Accepted (Pending Employment)
```

### Employer Dashboard:
```
Offer Accepted → Click "Mark as Hired" → Hired!
```

## 🔧 If Still Not Working

### Check Database Directly
Run this SQL in Supabase to see the actual status:
```sql
SELECT id, status, updated_at 
FROM job_applications 
WHERE status IN ('offer_received', 'offer_accepted', 'accepted')
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Server Logs
Look for this log message:
```
✅ Offer accepted notification created for applicant: [ID]
✅ Offer accepted notification created for employer: [ID]
```

## 📝 Code Verification

### Frontend (app/applicant-dashboard/page.tsx)
```typescript
// Line 1303
status: 'offer_accepted'  // ✅ CORRECT
```

### Backend (app/api/applications/update-status/route.ts)
```typescript
// Line 15
if (!['pending', 'accepted', 'rejected', 'reviewing', 'interview_scheduled', 'offer_received', 'offer_accepted', 'offer_declined'].includes(status))

// Lines 132-144
else if (status === 'offer_accepted') {
  // Create notification for applicant
}

// Lines 182-205
if (status === 'offer_accepted' && updatedApplication.job_posting?.employer_id) {
  // Create notification for employer
}
```

## ✅ Confirmation

After applying the fixes, you should see:
- ✅ Applicant accepts → Status: `offer_accepted`
- ✅ Emerald badge: "Offer Accepted - Pending Employment"
- ✅ Employer sees "Mark as Hired" button
- ✅ Employer clicks button → Status: `accepted`
- ✅ Green badge: "Hired! Welcome to the team!"
