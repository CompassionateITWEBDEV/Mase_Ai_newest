## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### **1. Accept Application (Stays Pending)**

```typescript
// Click "Accept Application"
onClick={() => {
  if (confirm(`Accept the application from ${applicantName}?`)) {
    // Status stays 'pending', add note to track acceptance
    updateApplicationStatus(appId, 'pending', 'Application accepted for interview scheduling')
  }
}}
```

**Result:**
- Status: `pending`
- Notes: Contains "Application accepted for interview scheduling"
- Reject button: DISABLED
- Schedule Interview: ENABLED

### **2. Schedule Interview (After Acceptance)**

```typescript
// "Schedule Interview" button logic
disabled={
  // Only enable if application is accepted
  !(status === 'pending' && notes?.includes('Application accepted'))
}
```

### **3. Hire Now (After Interview Date Passed)**

```typescript
// Check if interview happened
const relatedInterview = interviews.find(int => 
  int.applicant_id === application.applicant_id && 
  int.job_posting_id === application.job_posting_id
)

const interviewHasPassed = relatedInterview?.interview_date 
  ? new Date(relatedInterview.interview_date) < new Date()
  : false

// Only show if interview date has passed
return interviewHasPassed ? (
  <Button onClick={hireCandidate}>Hire Now</Button>
) : null
```
