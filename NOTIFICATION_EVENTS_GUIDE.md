## üîß Technical Implementation

### Notification Creation Flow

1. **Event Occurs** (e.g., application submitted, interview scheduled)
2. **API Endpoint Processes Event** (e.g., creates application, updates status)
3. **Notification Created** in `notifications` table
4. **Auto-Refresh System** picks up new notification (30 seconds)
5. **User Sees Notification** in their dashboard

### Database Structure

```sql
notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  employer_id UUID REFERENCES employers(id),     -- For employer notifications
  applicant_id UUID REFERENCES applicants(id),   -- For applicant notifications
  type TEXT NOT NULL,                             -- notification type
  title TEXT NOT NULL,                            -- notification title
  message TEXT NOT NULL,                          -- notification message
  action_url TEXT,                                -- link when clicked
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,                     -- read status
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Error Handling:** Notification failures don't stop the main operation
2. **Async Creation:** Notifications are created asynchronously
3. **User-Friendly Messages:** Use clear, actionable language
4. **Include Context:** Always mention job title, company name, etc.
5. **Action URLs:** Every notification should link to relevant page
6. **Console Logging:** Success/failure logged for debugging

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing?

1. **Check Database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM notifications 
   WHERE applicant_id = 'your-id' OR employer_id = 'your-id'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

2. **Check Console:**
   - Look for "‚úÖ notification created" messages
   - Look for error messages

3. **Check RLS Policies:**
   - Ensure migration `036-update-notifications-table.sql` was run
   - Verify policies allow SELECT for notifications

4. **Check Auto-Refresh:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for "Auto-refreshing notifications..." every 30 seconds

### Duplicate Notifications?

- Check if API endpoint is being called multiple times
- Verify event listeners are not duplicated
- Check for multiple auto-refresh intervals
