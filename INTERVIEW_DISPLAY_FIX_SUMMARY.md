# Interview Display Fix Summary

## âœ… What Was Fixed

The Interviews section in the Applicant Dashboard now displays interviews from the applications table, not just from the interview_schedules table.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

**File:** `app/applicant-dashboard/page.tsx` (lines 1366-1435)

### **Updated `loadInterviews()` Function:**

The function now:
1. Fetches applications with interview_scheduled status
2. Extracts interview data from applications
3. Combines with interviews from interview_schedules table
4. Displays all interviews in the Interviews tab

### **What Gets Displayed:**

- Job Title
- Company Name  
- Interview Date (formatted: "Monday, December 25, 2024")
- Interview Time
- Location
- Interviewer Name
- Notes
