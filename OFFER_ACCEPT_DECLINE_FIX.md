      method: 'PUT',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        applicationId,
        status: 'offer_accepted'  // ← Updates to offer_accepted
      })
    })

    if (data.success) {
      alert('✅ Congratulations! You have accepted the job offer!')
      loadApplications()  // Refresh to show new status

  }
}
```

  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/applications/update-status', {
      method: 'PUT',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        applicationId,

      })
    })

    if (data.success) {
