## 💡 When to Use Each Option

### **Use "Send Offer" When:**
- Need to formalize salary details
- Want to negotiate benefits
- Need signed offer letter
- Want to set specific start date
- Corporate/professional environment

### **Use "Hire Now" When:** ← **NEW!**
- Interview went very well
- Salary/terms already discussed verbally
- Need to hire urgently (fast track)
- Remote/simple hiring process
- Nursing/healthcare (urgent positions)

### **Use "Reject" When:**
- Candidate doesn't fit the role
- Skills don't match requirements
- Not meeting standards

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Database Changes:**
✅ **NO changes needed** - All status values already exist in database

### **Button Visibility Logic:**

```typescript
// Accept Application
{application.status === 'pending' || application.status === 'reviewing' && (
  <Button>Accept Application</Button>
)}

// Hire Now (After Interview) ← NEW!
{application.status === 'interview_scheduled' && (
  <Button onClick={confirmHire}>Hire Now</Button>
)}

// Mark as Hired (After Offer Accepted)
{application.status === 'offer_accepted' && (
  <Button>Mark as Hired</Button>
)}
```

3. **Day 2** - Employer schedules phone interview (status: `interview_scheduled`)
4. **Day 3** - Interview conducted (phone call)
5. **Day 3** - Interview goes great! Employer clicks "Hire Now"
6. Chong **Day 3** - Status: `accepted` (HIRED!) ← Fast!
7. Applicant receives notification: "Congratulations! You're Hired!"

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

### ✅ **Changes Made:**

1. **Added "Hire Now" button** that appears when status is `interview_scheduled`
2. **Confirmation dialog** before hiring
3. **Direct hire path** - interview_scheduled → accepted (skips offer process)
4. **Works in both places:**
   - Applications list
   - Application detail modal
5. **Uses Indigo color** to distinguish from other hiring button

### ✅ **Database:**
- **NO changes needed** - uses existing `accepted` status
- **Already supported** - status flow is valid
