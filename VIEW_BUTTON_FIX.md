# View Button Fix - All Applications Section

## 🔧 Problem
The "View" button in the "All Applications" section of the applicant dashboard had no onClick handler, making it non-functional.

## ✅ Solution
Added onClick handler to the View button that:
1. Sets the selected application
2. Opens the application details modal

## 📝 Changes Made

**File**: `app/applicant-dashboard/page.tsx` (Line 2420-2430)

### Before:
```tsx
<Button size="sm" variant="outline">
  <Eye className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
  View
</Button>
```

### After:
```tsx
<Button 
  size="sm" 
  variant="outline"
  onClick={() => {
    setSelectedApplication(application)
    setIsApplicationDetailsOpen(true)
  }}
>
  <Eye className="h-4 w-4 mr-1" />
  View
</Button>
```

## 🎯 Functionality
When clicked, the View button now:
- Sets the application as the selected application
- Opens the application details modal (`isApplicationDetailsOpen`)
- Shows comprehensive application information including:
  - Job information (position, company, location, salary, job type)
  - Application status
  - Interview details (if scheduled)
  - Offer details (if received)

## ✅ Status
**FIXED** - View button now works correctly in the All Applications section
