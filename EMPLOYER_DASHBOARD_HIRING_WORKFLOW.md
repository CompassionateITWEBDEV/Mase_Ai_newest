# Employer Dashboard Hiring Workflow - Implementation

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### Overview
Updated the employer dashboard to implement a **proper two-phase hiring workflow** that prevents premature "hiring" notifications and follows professional hiring practices.

---

## 📋 New Workflow

### Previous Flow (❌ Incorrect)
```
pending → "Accept Application" → accepted (HIRED immediately!)
```
**Problem**: Button said "Accept Application" but immediately sent "You're Hired!" notification, skipping interview/offer process.

### New Flow (✅ Correct)
```
pending → "Accept Application" → reviewing (qualified candidate)
                                    ↓
                              interview_scheduled
                                    ↓
                              offer_received
                                    ↓
                              offer_accepted
                                    ↓
                              "Mark as Hired" → accepted (HIRED!)
```

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. Frontend (app/employer-dashboard/page.tsx)

#### Two Button Locations Updated:
1. **Application List View** (lines ~2603-2629)
2. **Application Detail Modal** (lines ~3369-3403)

#### Button Logic:

**"Accept Application" Button:**
- **Shows when**: Status is `pending` or `reviewing`
- **Action**: Sets status to `reviewing`
- **Meaning**: Application is accepted for review (qualified candidate)
- **Color**: Green

**"Mark as Hired" Button:**
- **Shows when**: Status is `offer_accepted`
- **Action**: Sets status to `accepted`
- **Meaning**: Final hire confirmation
- **Color**: Emerald (distinguished from accept button)

---

### 2. Backend (app/api/applications/update-status/route.ts)

#### Notification Updates (lines ~141-154):

**When status = `reviewing`:**
- **Notification Title**: "Application Accepted for Review"
- **Message**: "Company has accepted your application. Being reviewed and you may hear back about next steps soon."
- **Type**: Information, not hiring

**When status = `accepted`:**
- **Notification Title**: "Congratulations! You're Hired!"
- **Message**: "Company has hired you for this position."
- **Type**: Hiring confirmation (only after offer accepted)
